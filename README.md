# SRT To Text Converter

This is a simple tool that I developed for myself to help optimize my workflow with subtitle revisions.
<br><br>
With this converter, I can copy & paste a text in SRT format, which includes timings, subtitle number and other things that get on the way while reviewing the text in a text reviewing tool, such as Microsoft Word.
<br><br>
The tool then removes all the "unwanted" tags and timings, and also remove the subtitling line breaks.
